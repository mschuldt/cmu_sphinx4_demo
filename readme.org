Building and running a minimal Sphynx4 demo on Linux without an IDE

Based on code and instructions from:  https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/tutorialsphinx4/

Build: =gradle build=

Run: =./run.sh=

Notes:

- Could only get it to work with the directory structure: src/main/java/DEMO/DEMO.java
- Configuration filenames in the demo file needed to be fixed
- =test.wav= copied from sphinx4/sphinx4-samples/build/resources/main/edu/cmu/sphinx/demo/speakerid/test.wav
- Ran =mvn install= but I'm not sure if it was actually needed
- =SPHINX_SRC= in run.sh and the configuration filepaths in =TranscriberDemo.java= need to be updated with the sphynx4 source directory path

Some build system notes, not mentioned in the instructions (probably obvious if you understand it):

- At top of =build.gradle= add: ~apply plugin: 'java'~
- Dependencies in =pom.xml= need to wrap with a 'dependencies' tag
- Other attributes needed for the =pom.xml= project:  modelVersion, groupId, artifactId, and version
